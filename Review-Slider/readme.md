# Review Carousel Project

This project is a simple yet functional **Review Carousel** built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to navigate through a list of reviews with previous and next buttons, dynamically updating the content without reloading the page.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to enhance and solidify JavaScript logic by implementing core concepts such as:

- DOM manipulation
- Conditional rendering
- Array navigation

## Features

- Navigate through reviews with "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
- Reviews include a name, profession, profile image, and personalized feedback.
- Button visibility dynamically updates (e.g., "Previous" button hides on the first review).
- Responsive design and user-friendly interface.

## üåê Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the Color Flipper [here](https://review-slider-eosin.vercel.app/).

## How It Works

1. JavaScript fetches data from an array of review objects.
2. Displays review details dynamically in the DOM.
3. Navigation buttons update the `currentIndex` and load the respective review.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZainUlAbedin2407/Review-Slider
   ```
2. Open the project folder and launch the `index.html` file in your browser.

- **HTML**: For the structure.
- **CSS**: For styling the layout.
- **JavaScript**: To handle functionality and logic.

## Learnings

- Mastered DOM manipulation and conditional rendering.
- Improved understanding of JavaScript functions and array handling.
- Strengthened debugging skills and project structuring.
