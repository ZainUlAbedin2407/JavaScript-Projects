# Roll the Dice 🎲

A fun and interactive two-player dice game where players compete to reach 100 points. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this game combines luck and strategy to create an engaging gaming experience.

## 🎮 Game Rules

1. Players take turns rolling a dice
2. Each roll gets added to the player's current score
3. Players can choose to:
   - **Roll Again**: Add more points to their current score
   - **Hold**: Bank their current points into their final score
4. Watch out! Rolling a '1':
   - Loses all points accumulated in the current turn
   - Switches to the other player
5. First player to reach 100 points (either through rolling or holding) wins!
